12,13,Catan,"In Catan (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)&mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone&mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.&#10;&#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&#10;&#10;Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&#10;&#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.&#10;&#10;",['Negotiation'],"['Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Modular Board', 'Route/Network Building', 'Trading']"
54254,150834,Pocket Paddles,"Pocket Paddles is a free print and play game for two players that fits in your wallet. All you need to play is the credit card-sized gameboard and 7 coins per player.&#10;&#10;In Pocket Paddles players compete in a furious paddle boat race. Whoever lands three ships on the sandy shores of Victor Island first, is declared winner, and is rewarded the platinum-power-paddle. The coins act as currency in a blind-bidding and bluffing round, in which the movement of your ships is determined. However, these coins also act as ships. Therefore, placing ships on the board drains your bidding resources.&#10;&#10;Tactics, wits and some winds of fate will carry the winner to Victor Island.&#10;&#10;","['Nautical', 'Print & Play', 'Racing']","['Auction/Bidding', 'Point to Point Movement']"

62950,178044,Small Star Empires,"Small Star Empires is a quick area control game for 2-4 players. In this game, players colonize the galaxy using their ships, which they move on a modular board containing hexagonal spaces (systems). The modular board is made up of seven different double-sided sector tiles, which allows for a different map and different experience each time you play the game.&#10;&#10;During a turn, a player must move one of their ships on the board. They can move the ship only in a straight line, as far away as they want, but they cannot go over systems controlled by other players. After moving the ship, the player has to choose whether to place a colony or a trade station in that system. Both of these mark control over the system until the end of the game, but the trade station gives the player bonus points for each adjacent system controlled by their opponents. The game ends when either all of the players have placed their colonies and trade stations on the board or until none of the players' ships can move (because they have become blocked by other players' systems).&#10;&#10;After the game ends, points are calculated. Each player gets one point for each planet that they have in their systems. (Systems have 1 to 3 planets on the board.) Players also earn points for Nebulae; the more they have from one color, the more points they earn, with bonus points from other special systems such as the Unexplored System Tiles, which are part of a variant in the game. After calculating the points, the player with the most points wins!&#10;&#10;","['Science Fiction', 'Territory Building']","['Area Control', 'Area Influence', 'Area Enclosure', 'Grid Movement', 'Modular Board']"
132,146,Buy Low Sell High,"Another of Reiner Knizia's fleet of games, this one is about making profits by buying and selling business stock. Players use cards to manipulate the price of three types of stocks (oil, technology, and retail), and the buying and selling of the stocks is pretty severely limited. Short and sweet, this game is both elegant and abstract.  In a change from the original version, the three stocks have different levels of volatility.  Technology is the most volatile, oil is the least volatile but with higher dividends, and retail falls in the middle.&#10;&#10;The original version of this game, Palmyra, was based around three trade routes which were represented by wooden amphoras.&#10;&#10;",['Economic'],['Commodity Speculation']

The game has a series of cards which represent each of the clubs, and are dealt out to the players at the start of the game.  The clubs go through an elimination cup series, with money being earned for victories, which can be spent on tokens representing star players.

15459,20569,Space Barons,"(Description based on prototype.)&#10;&#10;Space Barons is a quick game of trading space commodities, with commodities and thematic elements found in Felithian Finance, another Tom Wham unpublished game.  The theme includes many funny elements, such as the green eggs which could hatch, resulting in a fight against the awful green things from outer space :-)&#10;&#10;Inventory: map showing star systems and connections between them; rocket ship pawns, home base pawns, transporters (similar to monopoly houses), galactic credits (money chits), 4&quot;&times;6&quot; spaceship card with subsidiary engine and cargo hold cards, deck of delivery cards, deck of insurance cards, two six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;Players begin by selecting a spaceship dealer and rolling two six-sided dice, then buying one of the available spaceships.  They then build their home base (which doubles as a permanent transporter), selecting a star system from the map.  Each star system has a cost to build, ranging from 10-50, which indicates the value and number of deliveries that can be made to that system.&#10;&#10;On each turn, players are dealt two delivery cards, which specify a cargo and three destinations, varying in value.  The cargo is automatically available at the system where the player's rocket pawn is located.  The player may keep as many cards as their spaceship has cargo holds, freely selecting between new cards and previously retained cards.  On a player's turn, they may move their rocket pawn a number of systems equal to the number of engines on their spaceship.  Upon arrival at a system specified by their cards, they are paid for the cargo.&#10;&#10;There are no restrictions on arrival at a system.  However, to depart from a system a player must possess a matter transporter at that system, or pay another player to rent their transporter.  If no transporter is present, the player must build one on a later turn in order to move.&#10;&#10;During the game, players choose from a limited number of special actions, such as upgrading ships, building new transporters, advertising (to receive two extra delivery cards) or simply taking money (the least appealing option).  Only one special action may be taken each turn.&#10;&#10;Random events are included in the delivery deck.  Some of these can result in loss of spaceship or transporter, or devaluing of cargo.  A player may buy an insurance policy, partially covering the cost of losing a ship or transporter.&#10;&#10;The delivery deck has a reshuffle card.  Upon reshuffling, an end-of-game card is added to the delivery deck.  The player with the most money when the end-of-game card is revealed wins the game.&#10;&#10;","['Economic', 'Space Exploration', 'Transportation']","['Pick-up and Deliver', 'Trading']"
